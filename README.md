# Surreal Estate

I built this app using React and JavaScript as a project for Command Shift bootcamp. It was created using the npx script `create-react-app`. I wrote the tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Features
- The app has a navbar allowing users to navigate to different sections.
- All property listings can be viewed on the home page. Here, users can search by title, filter by location or sort by price.
- Users can contact the estate agent by clicking the `Email` button on each property card.
- Once users have created an account, they can sign in to add a property listing.
- Signed in users also have access to a `Saved Properties` section where they can save and remove property cards.

## Getting started

- Create a fork of this repo.
- Copy the fork's git address and clone to your machine using git clone.
- Use `npm install` to download the dependencies.
- Use `npm test` to run the tests.
- Use `npm start` to run the app in your browser.
